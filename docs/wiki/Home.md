# LagX (HBZCleaner) Wiki

Welcome to the LagX wiki. LagX is a Folia-optimized lag prevention and cleanup plugin (formerly HBZCleaner) that focuses on entity control, smart cleanup protocols, and actionable performance insights.

## Technical Background

LagX was originally inspired by the LaggRemover plugin but has been completely rewritten to support modern server versions (1.21+) and Folia threading. The architecture, protocols, and features have been extensively redesigned for better performance and maintainability.

Notes:

- Brand: User-facing name is LagX; package, main class, and permissions stay under `lagx.*` for compatibility.
- Commands: Use `/lagx` (alias of main command) and `/lagxperf` (alias of performance command). Legacy aliases like `/hbzcleaner` and `/hbzperf` still work.
