## [Previous Versions]

### Legacy LaggRemover Features (Enhanced & Modernized)

LagX preserves the core optimization philosophy of the original LaggRemover while delivering a completely **rearchitected experience** for modern servers. **All features have been thoughtfully rewritten** to ensure:

- **Full Folia compatibility** with proper region scheduler integration
- **Enhanced performance** through optimized, thread-safe implementations
- **Modern coding standards** that improve maintainability and extensibility

_Note: The module system and garbage collection functionality remain largely unchanged, as they were already well-implemented for our needs._

---

#### **Enhanced Features:**

- **Core Lag Removal Protocols**  
  Rewritten with Folia-safe threading and improved entity targeting algorithms
- **TPS Monitoring & Reporting**  
  Updated with more accurate tick tracking and real-time performance analytics
- **Memory Management**  
  Enhanced with better memory profiling and automatic cleanup triggers
- **Automatic Cleanup Scheduling**  
  Modernized with configurable schedules and intelligent lag detection
- **World & Chunk Management**  
  Rebuilt with improved chunk unloading and world-specific optimization
- **Entity & Item Clearing**  
  Enhanced with selective clearing, area-based operations, and detailed reporting
- **Module System**  
  _Preserved as-is_ - The original module architecture continues to work seamlessly

## Migration Guide

### From LaggRemover to LagX

1. **Backup your configuration** - Save existing `config.yml`
2. **Install LagX** - Replace the old JAR file
3. **Update permissions** - Change from `laggremover.*` to `lagx.*`
4. **Review new features** - Configure Entity Stacker and Entity Limiter
5. **Test functionality** - Verify all features work as expected

### Configuration Updates

- Entity stacker is **disabled by default** - enable if needed
- Villager optimizer provides significant performance gains
- Entity limiter presets simplify configuration management
- Towny integration is automatic if Towny is installed

### Command Changes

- All commands now use `/lagx` prefix
- New stacker management commands available
- Enhanced help system with pagination
- Improved status and diagnostic commands
