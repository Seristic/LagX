# Configuration Update v0.2.0

## Changes Made

### Version Update

- Updated config version from **0.1.7** to **0.2.0**

### Cleaned Up File Structure

- Removed misplaced `src/main/java/config.yml` (config files should only be in `resources/`)
- Kept proper config location: `src/main/resources/config.yml`

### Optional Features Now Disabled by Default

#### 1. Player "Lag" Trigger (doRelativeAction)

**Changed:** `doRelativeAction: true` â†’ `doRelativeAction: false`

**Reason:** This feature allows players to trigger lag cleanup by typing "lag" in chat. While useful, it can be abused by players to:

- Spam the system
- Remove entities they don't like
- Create performance issues if misused

**Recommendation:** Server administrators should manually enable this if they trust their player base.

#### 2. Map Protection (Anti-Corruption)

**Added new section with auto-scan disabled by default:**

```yaml
map-protection:
  auto-scan:
    enabled: false # Disabled by default
    interval: 5
  require-permission: false # Disabled by default
```

**Purpose:** This feature will automatically backup and restore map art data to prevent Minecraft's map corruption bug. When maps become corrupted or show as blank, they will be automatically restored from the backup.

**Status:** ðŸš§ Coming Soon - Not yet implemented

**Reason for being disabled:** Feature is not yet implemented. When ready, it will:

- Scan and backup map data at regular intervals
- Detect corrupted/blank maps
- Automatically restore maps from backup
- Prevent loss of valuable map art

**Use Cases for Enabling (when available):**

- Servers with valuable map art installations
- Protecting against Minecraft's map corruption bug
- Automatic recovery of blank/corrupted maps

### Features That Remain Enabled

These features are core performance optimizations and remain enabled by default:

- âœ… Entity and Item Stacker
- âœ… Auto-lag-removal (scheduled cleanup)
- âœ… Chunk management
- âœ… Entity limiter
- âœ… Villager optimization
- âœ… Item frame optimization
- âœ… Player death protection

## Configuration Philosophy

**Core Performance Features:** ON by default

- These directly improve server performance
- Low risk of interfering with gameplay
- Example: Entity limiting, chunk management, scheduled cleanup

**Optional/Restrictive Features:** OFF by default

- These modify player behavior or permissions
- Can interfere with intended gameplay
- Should be explicitly enabled by server admins
- Example: Map protection, player-triggered lag removal

## Migration Notes

If you were using `doRelativeAction` or expecting map protection, you'll need to explicitly enable these features in your config.yml after updating to v0.2.0.
